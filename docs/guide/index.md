# Guide

## Registration

You must register as a user on the platform before you can submit or review for the first time. To register go to the Pilcrow submission portal and choose the register link from the upper right corner of the page. If enabled, you may be able to register using an external identity provider like ORCID or Google so you can use your ORCID or Google account to authenticate. You will be asked for your name and email and to create a username. If you aren’t registering using an ORCID or Google account, you will also be asked to create a password. Once you are done with this, click the “Create Account” button.

You will be immediately logged into the system and you will see a yellow banner across the top that lets you know you need to verify your email by going to your email and clicking a link. You can resend the email if you don't get it. There may be delays with this email being sent. Be sure to check your junk mail because the email is sometimes filtered out.

The email will be titled “Verify Email Address,” and will come from the name of the Pilcrow instance you are registering for in the email. It will contain a button titled, “Verify Email Address.” Clicking this will verify your email and take you to the Pilcrow instance where you will see a success message and a button to visit the Dashboard page.

## Logging In

Once you have an account you can return to Pilcrow at any time and use the Login button to log in. If you ever forget your password you can reset it by pressing the reset password link on the login page, and by entering the email address you used to set up your account.

You will see a confirmation message when you press the submit button after entering your email address. Next, check your email. The email will come from the name of the Pilcrow instance you are registering for and will be titled Reset Password Notification. Inside the email, you will see a button titled “Reset Password.” Pressing this button will take you to the Pilcrow instance with a prompt to enter your new password. Once you have submitted your new password you’ll see a confirmation that the password has been reset and a button to return to the dashboard.

Note that the password reset link must be used within 60 minutes of requesting a password reset or you will have to start the process again.

## Profile

One of the first things you can do when you log in to Pilcrow is update your profile. In the upper right corner of the page click the arrow button next to your username. This will load the standard profile that will only be populated with your username and name. You can fill out as many or as few fields on this page as you wish. Once you have made the changes scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see a purple “SAVE” button to save them. If you press a button to navigate away from the page before you have saved it, the system will prompt you to discard the changes or to keep them.
