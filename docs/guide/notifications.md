# Notifications

There are two different types of notifications in Pilcrow: in-app and email. As a user, you will receive notifications for different activities that take place depending upon your role relative to the activities.

For example, if you’re a reviewer of a submission, you will be notified whenever someone changes the status of the submission you’re reviewing. The user changing the status of the submission will have the opportunity to provide an optional comment. This optional comment will be included in this activity’s email notification. This optional comment will also appear within the Activity section at the bottom of the submission’s Details page.

Not all activities will trigger a notification, as the development team considers this an ongoing project and is still developing notifications. If you’d like to suggest to the development team that a notification be triggered for a particular activity, feel free to contact the development team to do so.
